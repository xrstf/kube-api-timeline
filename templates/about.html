                Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration engine for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.

              An instance of Kubernetes is called a &quot;cluster&quot; and within such a cluster, resources are stored that describe
              the desired state of the world. A resource could for example be a ConfigMap, which can contain arbitrary configuration
              values that can then be consumed by applications in the cluster. All the resources available in a cluster are versioned
              and grouped based on their purpose and are considered the API of a Kubernetes cluster.

            <p>
              Kubernetes' cluster orchestration is based upon resources, which are defined in various
              <strong>API groups</strong> (based on their purpose, like <code>apps</code>
              for application management or <code>rbac.authorization.k8s.io</code> to manage
              permissions inside a Kubernetes cluster). Resources are often viewed and interacted with
              in the form of YAML and an example resource, a <code>ConfigMap</code>, could looke like this:
            </p>

            <pre>
apiVersion: core/v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-app-config
data:
  database: "sql://user:pass@182.18.265.99:123/"
  theme: "dark"
  environment: "production"
            </pre>

            <p>
              To allow for these APIs to evolve over
              time, each API group defines a set of <strong>API versions</strong>. These follow
              a simple naming convention of <code>vN</code> followed by an optional maturity level
              (for example <code>beta1</code>), so an API could evolve like
              <code>v1alpha1</code> –&gt;
              <code>v1beta1</code> –&gt;
              <code>v1beta2</code> –&gt;
              <code>v1</code> –&gt;
              <code>v2alpha1</code>.<br>
              Each API version then provides a set of <strong>Resources</strong>. The <code>apps/v1</code>
              group version for example provides <code>Deployments</code> and <code>DaemonSets</code>,
              whereas the <code>rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1</code> group offers resources like
              <code>ClusterRoles</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
              The set of API groups and their versions and resources can be dynamically
              queried in a Kubernetes cluster in a process called &quot;service discovery&quot;.
              This can be done using the standard Kubernetes CLI tool <code>kubectl</code> and
              running the command <code>kubectl api-resources</code>.

              &quot;Archived&quot; is a totally arbitrary distinction made solely for the purpose
              of keeping the timeline to a consistent width. As new Kubernetes releases come out,
              not all screen sizes would be able to keep up, so I had to make a cut somewhere.

              The default view on kube-api.ninja will show a table
              of the 10 most recent Kubernetes releases (one per
              column). Older releases can be shown, but are only
              listed for historical purpose (if you have to administer
              a Kubernetes environment using an archived release,
              may the sun always be shining on you).
            </p>

            <p>
              The columns marked green represented releases that are
              currently supported by the Kubernetes maintainers and
              will receive updates and security fixes.
            </p>

            <p>
              Each row represents an API group and shows with a green
              bar in which Kubernetes releases the group is available.
              An empty cell means that the API is not available in that
              Kubernetes release.<br>
              The text in the API group cells shows the <strong>preferred</strong>
              version to use. Preferred is not necessarily the <em>latest</em>
              version, but the most mature (for example if both <code>v1</code>
              and <code>v2beta1</code> are available, <code>v1</code> is
              preferred).
            </p>

            <p>
              By clicking on an API group, the group can be expanded to
              show all individual API versions for that group. The bars now
              make use of multiple colors:
            </p>

            <ul>
              <li>
                A <span class="badge text-bg-success rounded-pill">green</span> bar
                means that the API version is available and the preferred version
                in that Kubernetes release.
              </li>
              <li>
                A <span class="badge text-bg-warning rounded-pill">yellow</span> bar
                means that the API version is available, but not preferred.
              </li>
              <li>
                An empty cell means the API version is not available at all.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              Just as you can expand an API group to show its versions, you can ultimately
              expand an API version to show the resources it offers. Note that during the
              lifetime of an API version, resources can be added and in unstable versions,
              resources can even be removed again.

              Cluster administrators can restrict the set of available APIs globally

              Third party software in your cluster can extend the available APIs. For example
              Jetstack's cert-manager introduces its own API, <code>cert-manager.io/v1</code>,
              to manage TLS certificates. While third party APIs are not bound to Kubernetes
              releases, it is entirely possible that as part of your cluster upgrade, you would
              also need to upgrade cert-manager, which in itself might deprecate its <code>v1</code>
              and instead use <code>v2</code> now.
            </p>

            <p>
              When planning a cluster upgrade, check all API versions in use in your cluster
              (for example using <code>kubectl api-resources</code>). For core APIs you can use
              this website to get a feeling for the impact, but each third party API needs to be
              checked invidually.
            </p>

            <p>
              There are tools available to help you scan your cluster for resources that could
              become a problem when upgrading. This is a non-exhaustive alphabetical list:

              There are three aspects that are considered notable:
            </p>

            <ol>
              <li>
                An API resource is added. This is shown to give an early hint that
                an updated version is available so developers and users can start
                to migrate instead of waiting until the resource / version becomes
                unavailable.
              </li>
              <li>
                An API resource is removed. This is simply a breaking change
                and it means cluster contents must be upgraded to not use the
                removed resource before control plane upgrade is attempted.
              </li>
              <li>
                A more mature API version becomes available, but only if this
                new version offers at least one of the existing API resources.
                For example if <code>apps.v1alpha1/DaemonSet</code> was available
                in release 1.17 and 1.18 begins to offer <code>apps.v1beta1/DaemonSet</code>,
                then this is a notable change in 1.18. However if the new <code>v1beta1</code>
                would not offer <code>DaemonSets</code> (yet), the new version is not a notable
                change, as it is not relevant when planning cluster upgrades.
